.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a file-based IRC client.
It is heavily inspired by
.Xr ii 1
but offers more features, e.g. built-in TLS support.
.Pp
Just as
.Xr ii 1
.Nm
creates a directory tree for the server (the master channel) containing
subdirectories for every conversation started on that server.
This includes public IRC channels and private conversations with other
users.
.Pp
On startup
.Nm
attempts to connect to the given
.Ar server .
If a connection was established successfully it automatically creates
directories for the given
.Ar targets
(if any).
Directories for users are only created automatically if the server
supports the IRCv3.2
.Em MONITOR
command and the user is currently online.
.Nm
makes no attempt to reestablish the connection, it simply terminates
when the connection to the IRC server is lost.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl k Pa key
Path to PEM encoded key used for client authorization using TLS, also
known as
.Em CertFP .
This requires
.Fl c
and
.Fl t
to be given as well.
.It Fl c Pa cert
Certificate
Path to PEM encoded certificate used for client authorization using TLS,
also known as
.Em CertFP .
This requires
.Fl k
and
.Fl t
to be given as well.
.It Fl r Pa certs

This requires
.Fl t
to be given as well.
Defaults to the host's root CA set.
.It Fl f Ar name
Real name associated with the user's nick.
Defaults to the user's login name.
.It Fl i Pa prefix

subdirectory.
Default to

.It Fl p Ar port
TCP port used to connect to the IRC server.

Contrary to text in the
.Pa out
file the debug output is not sanitized and might contain ANSI escape
sequences or other non-printable characters.
.It Fl s
Attempt SASL authentication using the SASL EXTERNAL method with TLS
client certificates.
This requires
.Fl k ,
.Fl c ,
and
.Fl t
to be given as well.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "usr"
.It Pa in
A FIFO used to send messages to the IRC server.
If the message is prefixed with a backlash it is send to the server as
is.
Otherwise it is interpreted as a
.Em PRIVMSG
and send to the target associated with the subdirectory.
This file is removed on program termination.
.It Pa out
A regular file containing messages received for the target associated
with the subdirectory.
This file is not removed on program termination.
.It Pa id
A regular file containing a unique id for identifying the target
associated with the subdirectory.
This file does not exist in the master channel directory and is not
removed on program termination.
.It Pa usr
A UNIX domain socket which reports the nicks of all users currently
present in an IRC channel.
Nicks are separated by a newline and are written descending by last
activity to the socket.
The socket only exists in subdirectories associated with IRC channels
and is closed on program termination.
.It Pa log
A regular file containing received messages which either mention the
user's nick or were received through private conversations.
This file is not removed on program termination.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS

.Sh BUGS
.Nm
has tight restrictions regarding directory names for both security and
compatibility reasons.
The problem with this being that directory names are not unique.
For instance, joining a channel named
.Em #foo|bar
and a channel named
.Em #foo/bar
is not possible since they are assigned the same directory name.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a file-based IRC client.
It is heavily inspired by
.Xr ii 1
but offers more features, e.g. built-in TLS support.
.Pp
Just as
.Xr ii 1
.Nm
creates a directory tree for the server (the master channel) containing
subdirectories for every conversation started on that server.
This includes public IRC channels and private conversations with other
users.
.Pp
On startup
.Nm
attempts to connect to the given
.Ar server .
If a connection was established successfully it automatically joins the
given IRC
.Ar channels
(if any).
.Nm
makes no attempt to reestablish the connection, it simply terminates
when the connection to the IRC server is lost.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds

.It Pa usr
A UNIX domain socket which reports the nicks of all users currently

Nicks are separated by a newline and written in alphabetic order to the
socket.

.Sh BUGS
.Nm
has tight restrictions regarding directory names for both security and
compatibility reasons.
The problem with this being that directory names are not unique.
For instance, joining a channel named
.Em #foo|bar
and a channel named
.Em #foo/bar
is not possible since they are assigned the same directory name.

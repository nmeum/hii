.Nm hii
.Nd Output file format of the hii IRC client
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Pa out
files created by
.Xr hii 1
consist of newline separated records for IRC events, record fields are
separated by an ASCII space character.
The first field is a timestamp from Unix epoch at which the event was
received.
All other fields are essentially user controlled and differ for
different kinds of IRC events.
.Pp
ASCII format codes as well as non-printable characters are removed from
all IRC events.
However,
.Nm
itself adds non-printable characters suffixes as the last character of a
record to identify special classes of IRC events.
The following ASCII suffixes are currently supported:
.Bl -tag -width acknowledge-(0x06) -offset 2m
.It acknowledge (0x06)
The event is a
.Em PRIVMSG
or
.Em NOTICE
send by the own client.
.It bell (0x07)
The event is a
.Em PRIVMSG
or
.Em NOTICE
either containing the user's nick or a send directly to the user.
.El
.Pp
The
.Pa log
file created by
.Nm
uses a similar format.
In contrast to
.Pa out
files each record represents a
.Em PRIVMSG
or
.Em NOTICE
and contains at least three field: A timestamp (see above), a channel
where the event originated (enclosed in square brackets) and an event
source (enclosed in parentheses).
Additionally, the
.Pa log
file format does not use any special suffixes.

.Pa out
file might looks as follows:
